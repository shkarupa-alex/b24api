# Migrating to b24api 2.x

Version 2 intentionally removes compatibility wrappers. Migrate by capability rather than by
preserving names or return-shaping flags.

| Earlier capability | 2.x operation | Important difference |
|---|---|---|
| Decoded `call()` | `call()` | Returns detached decoded JSON. |
| Raw/envelope call | `call_response()` | Always returns the immutable `Response` type. |
| Disable retries | `ExecutionPolicy(max_attempts_per_request=1)` | Replay safety is separately declared on `Request`. |
| Finite batch | `batch(Command(...))` | The logical source may be arbitrarily long; physical chunks remain bounded. |
| Payload tuples / `with_payload` | `Command.correlation` | Correlation stays off-wire and is present on typed outcomes. |
| Tolerant batch | `batch_outcomes()` | Handle the closed success/failure/not-executed/unknown union. |
| Sequential offset list | `iter_list()` | Conservative default; follows server continuation sequentially. |
| Counted batched list | `iter_list_counted()` | Direct head plus physically batched tail; requires exact total and identity. |
| No-count/keyset list | `iter_list_keyset()` | Exact sequential keyset; requires a reliable unique identity filter/order. |
| Cursor wrappers | `iter_list_cursor()` | Requires a strict unique monotonic cursor. |
| Independent request wrappers | `fan_out()` / `fan_out_outcomes()` | Explicit direct or batch dispatch and delivery order. |
| Per-parent/reference wrappers | `Binding` + `iter_references()` / `iter_reference_outcomes()` | Parent correlation and traversal state are explicit and isolated. |

## Removed intentionally

- return-type-changing Python flags;
- tuple-shaped payload conventions;
- automatic endpoint profiles and method-name inference;
- permissive cursor de-duplication that could hide missing rows;
- automatic unsafe direct fallback;
- public low-level execution plans and compatibility data models.

There is no generic fast no-count shortcut in 2.x. If an endpoint supplies an exact filtered total,
use `iter_list_counted()`. Otherwise use exact keyset/cursor traversal or an application-owned
workflow with endpoint-specific reconciliation.

## Practical migration order

1. Replace direct calls and choose `call()` versus `call_response()` by required return type.
2. Mark replay safety explicitly for operations whose semantics are known.
3. Replace payload tuples with `Command.correlation` or `Binding.correlation`.
4. Choose list traversal from the table in README based on evidence the endpoint actually exposes.
5. Consume terminal reports and tolerant outcome unions exhaustively.
6. Add application checks for business filters and composite identities; the generic client cannot
   infer them from method names.
